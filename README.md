# ERRANT for Gujarati 
**Part of**: *Smruti: Grammatical Error Correction for Gujarati using LLMs with Non-Parametric Memory*

## Overview

This repository provides a Gujarati-specific adaptation of the ERRANT framework (Bryant et al., 2017) for grammatical error correction (GEC). While the original ERRANT toolkit was developed for English, this version extends its applicability to Gujaratiâ€”a morphologically rich, low-resource Indic language.
The adapted framework is employed to evaluate the *Smruti* system across both human-annotated and synthetically generated datasets. It facilitates interpretable, reproducible performance measurement for GEC in Gujarati.

## Acknowledgments

We thank the original authors of ERRANT for their foundational work and open-source release. This adaptation was developed using native linguistic insights to support GEC research in Gujarati and other under-resourced Indian languages.
